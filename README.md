# Baggage Records Processing Tool

## About
This project was created as part of a group report for Avinor in the TDT4259 course, and created by Group 18 (Espen, Nikolai, Marcus, Andreas, Ola, Anders).

The Java-project contains functionality to filter baggage records using custom rule sets. 

A custom rule execution pattern and parallelism has been used in order to reduce time and lower complexity.
